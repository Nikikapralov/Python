1. Writing good quality code is always more important than getting the job done and refactoring it later. A program should be easy to change, with plug and play features so that it can evolve
with changing requirements.


2. OOP - Dependency Inversion
Dependency Inversion allows for the concurrent development of independent features from multiple 
developers. By strictly following this method, a feature is not dependent on another but on its interface which means that multiple features can be interchanged (plug and play) without harming
the application.

3. Functional Programming - Involves the use of immutable variables. Using such variables prevents race conditions, deadlocks, livelocks etc. It is a good idea to have most of our code as immutable by concurrent processes and just a small amount of it as mutable if it is necessary, wrapped in a transaction as a fallback.

4. Event sourcing - transactions are stored but not the state of the value. As such, to receive the value, one must evaluate the transactions and will not rely on a potentially vulnerable from 
race conditions value. Not sustainable but a good idea.

5. Single responsibility - Seperate the code that different actors depend on, so that if one requires a change, it does not effect the other, for example if they depend on the same function or if 2 developers attempt to merge the code that should have been in 2 modules but was written in 1, this may cause unexpected problems. EXAMPLE - The Facade design pattern is used to enforce the SRP. Instead of one class incorporating many methods that may depend on different actors,
the class receives classes with the methods, where each class is responsible for one actor. As such the big class is broken up into a Facade which receives and later delegates the life of the smaller classes.

6. Open Closed Principle - A class is open for extension but closed for change. We should design our programs as Plug and Play systems, that allow of the interchangeability of code fragments without necessatating modification of already existing code. This principle reinforces the Single reponsibility principle mentioned earlier. Data collection, data modification, each point where a 
change is to be expected is to be created as a flexible fragment, with the necessary dependency inversion.

7. Liskov Substitution - If class A and class B are in the same use group, then substituting class A for class B should not require any change to the codebase for the functionality to be kept the same. For example, all figures with 4 sides should have the ability to define all 4 sides in the constructor, regardless if that is square, a rectangle or another figure. If that is not kept as such, then an If condition must be used to check what parameters to be passed to what class. This will prove significantly tedious to keep track of, the more the application grows.

8. Interface Segregation Principle - Depending on something that one does not use may cause problems in the future when that part changes and inadvertently forces a redeploy that could have been avoided. To solve this problem, segregate a class into multiple interfaces, with each user of this class receiving only the specific interface and its methods that it actually needs. As such, a change in class A will not force a redeployment of the other classes, since their dependency will be small interface, rather than a monolithic one.

9. Dependency Inversion Principle - Reduce the dependency of a component on other components to its maximum. To make this happen, we can create a class of the user and pass the needed classes with their functions and data to the constructor already instatiated. This may happen manually or most likely in another Factory class that will generate the dependencies and pass them down onto 
the User class as ready instances. This principle cannot be fully implemented, as such priority is to be given to functionalities that change often, may change in the future or are currently under devlopment, in other words, volatile fragments of code. Set in stone functionalities may be dependent on, though care must be taken, else a lengthy refactoring will take place.
